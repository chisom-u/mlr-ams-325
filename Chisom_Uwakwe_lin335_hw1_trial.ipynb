        "1. Go back to your Github repository. Once you hit refresh, you should see the notebook in the repository. You can click on it to view it on Github. This will be exactly what your notebook will look like to us when we grade it.\n",
        "1. There's one more, crucial step. Since your repository is private, only you can view it. You will have to give us access. In the repository, click on `Settings` in the top bar, then on `Collaborators and teams` in the left sidebar. Click the green button that says `Add people`, then add the usernames that are specified in the Brightspace announcement for this assignment. When asked for the level of access, pick `Write`."
